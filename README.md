### GeneticAlgorithmToFindAPhrase
Uses a kind of a genetic algorithm to find a phrase that you want. My first Machine Learning project.

##Instructions
**For users:**
1. Go to GeneticAlgo/dist/GeneticAlgo.jar
2. Click Download

**For Linux Users**
1. Open up shell using Ctrl+Alt+t
2. Navigate to the folder that contains GeneticAlgo.jar
3. Make sure you have java by typing `java -version`. To download java, go here: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_x64_install.xml
4. Type `java -jar GeneticAlgo.jar`
5. A UI should pop up. Modify the settings if you want, then click "Run".

**For Windows Users**
1. Open up the Terminal by right-clicking on the Start Button, then clicking "Run".
2. Type `cmd`
3. Navigate to the folder that contains GeneticAlgo.jar using `cd`
4. Type `java -jar GeneticAlgo.jar`
5. A UI should pop up. Modify the settings if you want, then click "Run".

**For Developers**
1. Just download the entire thing. Using Netbeans to edit this stuff is pretty cool.
  

You might have to look at the stats and stuff with the console, because awt doesn't want to update the statistics for some reason. No solution just yet. Anyways, this is my first genetic algorithm so I hope you enjoy it :D
