## GeneticAlgorithmToFindAPhrase
Uses a kind of a genetic algorithm to find a phrase that you want. My first Machine Learning project.

# Instructions
**For users:**
1. Go to GeneticAlgo/dist/GeneticAlgo.jar
2. Click Download

**For Linux Users**
1. Open up shell using Ctrl+Alt+t
2. Navigate to the folder that contains GeneticAlgo.jar
3. Make sure you have java by typing `java -version`. To download java, go here: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_x64_install.xml
4. Type `java -jar GeneticAlgo.jar`
5. A UI should pop up. Modify the settings if you want, then click "Run". The default settings are recommended.
6. After the program finishes running, it should display 
`PROGRESS:[✓] [100% ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇]`
7. It should also display `Program ended.`

**For Windows Users**
1. Open up the Terminal by right-clicking on the Start Button.
2. Click "Run"
3. Type "cmd"
4. Navigate to the folder that contains GeneticAlgo.jar using `cd`
5. Type `java -jar GeneticAlgo.jar`
6. A UI should pop up. Modify the settings if you want, then click "Run". The default settings are recommended.
7. After the program finishes running, it should display

**For Developers**
1. Click "Clone or Download"
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Extract files to a destination of choice
4. I recommend using Netbeans to edit this. If you are using Netbeans:
5. Launch Netbeans
6. Click the icon ![Open Project Icon](NetBeansOpenProjectIcon.png) on the top bar of the IDE.
7. Then select the folder "GeneticAlgo" from the directory you extracted the ZIP file to.
8. The icon should have a little coffee icon that signifies it's a NetBeans project.
9. Have fun editing :smile:
  

You might have to look at the stats and stuff with the console, because awt doesn't want to update the statistics for some reason. No solution just yet. Anyways, this is my first genetic algorithm so I hope you enjoy it :D
